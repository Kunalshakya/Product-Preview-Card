### What I learned

A product preview card component is a user interface element used to display a preview of a product, typically used on an e-commerce website or app. Here are some things I may have learned about product preview card components project:

- Displaying key product information: The product preview card component should display key information about the product, such as the product name, image, price, and rating.

- Consistency: It's important to maintain consistency in the design of product preview card components across the website or app to ensure a cohesive user experience.

- Responsiveness: The component should be responsive and adjust to different screen sizes and resolutions.

- Visual hierarchy: The component should have a clear visual hierarchy, with the most important information (such as the product name and image) given prominence over secondary information (such as the product description).

- Accessibility: The component should be designed with accessibility in mind, such as providing alternative text for images for users who rely on screen readers.

- Performance: The component should be optimized for performance to ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience.
